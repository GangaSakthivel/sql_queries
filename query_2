Imagine you have the following table for employee attendance:

Attendance Table:
EmployeeID	Name	AttendanceDate	Status
101	Alice	2024-01-01	Present
102	Bob	2024-01-01	Absent
103	Charlie	2024-01-01	Present
101	Alice	2024-01-02	Absent
102	Bob	2024-01-02	Present
103	Charlie	2024-01-02	Present
Task:
Write a SQL query to find:

The total number of days present for each employee.
The total number of days absent for each employee.
The attendance percentage for each employee.
The output should look like this:

EmployeeID	Name	TotalPresentDays	TotalAbsentDays	AttendancePercentage
101	Alice	1	1	50%
102	Bob	1	1	50%
103	Charlie	2	0	100%

solution

SELECT EmployeeID, 
       Name, 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN Status = 'Present' THEN 1 END) AS TotalPresentDays,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN Status = 'Absent' THEN 1 END) AS TotalAbsentDays,
       ROUND(
           (COUNT(CASE WHEN Status = 'Present' THEN 1 END) * 100.0) / 
           (COUNT(CASE WHEN Status IN ('Present', 'Absent') THEN 1 END)), 2
       ) AS AttendancePercentage
FROM attendance
GROUP BY EmployeeID, Name;
