Scenario & Query Question
Imagine you have the following table for sales transactions:

Sales Table:
TransactionID	Product	Amount	TransactionDate
201	Laptop	1000	2024-01-15
202	Phone	500	2024-02-10
203	Tablet	700	2024-02-20
204	Laptop	1200	2024-02-25
205	Phone	600	2024-03-05
Task:
Write a SQL query to find:

The total sales amount for each product.
The number of transactions for each product.
The average transaction amount for each product.
The output should look like this:

Product	TotalSales	TransactionCount	AverageTransactionAmount
Laptop	2200	2	1100
Phone	1100	2	550
Tablet	700	1	700

Solution 
SELECT product, 
       ROUND(SUM(amount), 2) AS TotalSales, 
       COUNT(TransactionID) AS TransactionCount, 
       ROUND(AVG(amount), 2) AS AverageTransactionAmount
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
